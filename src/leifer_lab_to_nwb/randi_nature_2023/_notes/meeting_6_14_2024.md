## Redoing segmentation to get masks

Was the usage of command line argument `select_max` (ref: https://github.com/leiferlab/wormdatamodel/blob/2ab956199e3931de41a190d2b9985e961df3810c/wormdatamodel/signal/extraction.py#L177) recorded anywhere? For exact reproducibility I might need to or it might help to know

Same for `box_size`? Would these always be in the `info` of the `pkl` file if they were modified from the defaults?

Main part I'm stuck on now is how to find the `Neuron` coordinates passed into the `Signal.extract` method? Might be useful to see how these tools are used in practice on raw data to fully understand the mechanism



## Code for generating figures from paper

I have found all information for this and have no further questions



## Processed levels of segmeentaiton

They are hearing from collaborators that unprocessed forms of data may also be useful

Need to check with Emily how many different combinations of preprocessing (such as photobleaching, nan interpolation) are desired
