# Meeting on 5/15/2024

They will start transferring more raw like data storage plus metadata for matching subjects to sessions

## Raw data

Top is always red, green is always bottom.

May have to correct coordinates in other files for 1024 split


## Objective registration

Objective registration folder may not be used for analysis.

Also ignore redgreen registration files; those get copied over to pumpprobe


## Segmentation

Segmentation; masks are per volume (unique), not interpolated

Separate segmentation for multicolor and pumprobe; masks not saved 



## Mmatches in matchex.txt/matches.pickle

matches.txt/.pickle; In matches file, -1 means not matches, matched tracking vs matchless tracking. 

MMmatch might be motion tracking?



## Mapping from multicolor IDs to pumpprobe IDs

Mapping from multicolor to pumpprobe is a separate file.


## Excitation/emissions

Excitation of multicolor is excitation of pumprobe red/green

Same filter on red; the green would be different for GCamp?
